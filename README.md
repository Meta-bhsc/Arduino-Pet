# Arduino Dinosaur Pet

This code is for a little dinosaur pet run on an Arduino. I just used an Arduino Nano, a few buttons, and a small OLED display.

## Buttons

There are 4 buttons:

- Bathroom: connected to pin 4
- Feed: connected to pin 3
- Stats: connected to pin 2
- Play: connected to pin 5

## Buzzer

There is also a buzzer connected to pin 9.
